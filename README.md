**NOTICE**: Redistributing any of my packages and/or their contents, modified or unmodified, without my direct permission is prohibited.

## A list of the packages' contents and their functions, ordered by significance
### Schr√∂dinger's cubes
A cut testing element reimplemented by me from scratch. They are a pair of cubes, when a laser enters one cube, it comes out of the other. You can read more about them here: https://tcrf.net/Portal_2#Schr.C3.B6dinger.27s_Cube.
- **Start enabled** controls whether the cube will drop automatically when the map is loaded.
- **Start active** controls whether a replacement cube will be delivered automatically when the cube is destroyed.
- **Cube type** allows you to link cubes together - For example, a cube with the cube type set to sphere will activate all other cubes with the cube type set to sphere, one with the type set to standard will activate all with the type set to standard, and so on.
- Due to an editor bug, this item can be attached to floor surfaces. It will not work when floor-oriented, however.
- Due to various limitations of Portal 2, it is not possible to restore the paint-sharing functionality, unfortunately.
### Hybrid style
A style that aims to merge Portal 1's and Portal 2's aesthetical styles. Inspired by Zepalesque's *Portal: Enrichment* videos.
### Enhanced Surface Marker
A fixed and expanded version of the surface marker item that can force 5 different tile patterns and 5 different textures onto walls. For a more in-depth guide on how to use it, please consult the [wiki](https://github.com/AxoLabs/BEE2-Axos-Packages/wiki/Enhanced-surface-markers).
### Resilient Cube
A blue-colored variant of the weighted box. It is far more durable than most cubes, rendering it immune to weaker methods of dissolving.
- It can safely pass through standard fizzlers, death fizzlers, and matter inquisition fields. Absolute fizzlers, energy pellets and goo will still dissolve it.
- To ensure it cannot be smuggled between test chambers, it causes exit and chamberlock fizzlers to become absolute fizzlers.
- Sending an input to a linked dropper will also destroy the cube.
- Much like the cube bomb and the bumbleball, it can be linked to a dropper using either the timer, or by being placed under a cube dropper.
### Cube hole
A hole cubes and such can pass through, but the player can not.
### Autoportal variants
- Protruding autoportal: An autoportal mounted on a surface protruding from the wall by 8 units.
- Angled autoportal, an autoportal mounted on an angled surface. **Button type** allows you to switch between an angle of 60, 45, and 30 degrees.
- Unlinked autoportal, an autoportal that is not linked to your portal gun. Use the **timer** to select the linkage ID.
- For all three, the start **start enabled** option controls whether the portal starts active or not.
- For all three, **start reversed** controls whether the portal is orange or blue.
### Large glass panels
A larger, unembedded version of the normal glass panel.
- **Start deployed** controls whether the panel starts raised/extended or not.
- **Start reversed** when checked, switches to the 128x256 model.
- If input B is used, instead of raising by 90 degrees, upon activation, the panel will extend by a voxel.
### Suspended panel
A surface held by a panel a voxel above the ground.
- Check **start reversed** to make it non-portalable.
### Half stairs
A set of stairs that only reaches half a voxel of height.
- **Start reversed** controls which part of the voxel the stairs occupy - Unchecked for the top part, checked for the bottom.
- The stair tiles will change color depending on the color of the tile they're placed on.
### Protruding surface
A portalable surface, protruding out a wall. Comes with a powerful portal magnet implemented into it. **Start reversed** makes the plastic textures darker.
