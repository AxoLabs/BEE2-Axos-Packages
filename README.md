# BEE2-Axo's-Packages
Supported version of BEEMod: 2.4.43.0.

Supported styles: OG Clean. Custom fizzlers have emitters styled for all styles, and cube dropper gel droppers have a P1-style variant, but no support for those styles beyond that is planned.

*By the way, if you are going to use one of these in a puzzle, could you please credit me? I just want more people to know about these, up to you though :)*

If you want to suggest an enhancement, or report a bug, please read the **contributing guidelines**: https://github.com/AxoLabs/BEE2-Axos-Packages/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md

#### Purple paint fizzler: 
- A modified version of the default paint fizzler that is purple. Fully compatible with the original.
#### Portal condensation grid: 
- A custom fizzler built off the default paint fizzler. Blocks portal shots and fizzles portals, but does not affect cubes. 
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage.
#### Concentrated particle field:
- A custom fizzler originally made for PHOBoS. It is a combination of my Portal Condensation Grid and the Physics Repulsion Field.
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage.
#### Portal support grid
- A custom fizzler that is essentially a toggle-able wall you can place portals on!
- Inspired by the Portalable Field from the _Divinity_ series.
#### Portal lights enabler:
- A custom item made partially using BEEPKG that enables `r_portal_use_dlights` when placed in a map.
#### Cube dropper gel Dropper:
- A custom variant of the gel dropper that uses a cube dropper model instead. Use `Cube Type` to select the gel dropper. Also has a `Start Enabled` option. BEEPKG was used to generate a package template for this item.
- Has styled variants for Clean styles and P1 style.
- If set to drop Reflection Gel, it will pack the custom particles into the map.
- Uses the same instance for all types of gel.
#### Reflection gel fixer
- Changes the color of Reflection gel to be gray when splashed on surfaces and your face.
#### Schrodinger's cubes
- A cut testing element reimplemented by me from scratch. You can read about them here: https://tcrf.net/Portal_2#Schr.C3.B6dinger.27s_Cube
- They are a bit buggy, but should work mostly fine.
