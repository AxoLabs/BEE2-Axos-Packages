# BEE2-Axo's-Packages
**U**ser **c**reated **p**ackages (UCPs) for BEEMod 2.4 made by AxoLabs.

Supported version of BEEMod: 2.4.43.0.

Supported styles: OG Clean, Clean and P1. Custom fizzlers have old AP-styled emitters and icons, but no support for those styles beyond that is planned.

*By the way, if you are going to use one of these in a puzzle, could you please credit me? I just want more people to know about these, up to you though :)*

If you want to suggest an enhancement, or report a bug, please read the **contributing guidelines**: https://github.com/AxoLabs/BEE2-Axos-Packages/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md

### The Purple Paint Fizzler UCP: 
- A modified version of the default paint fizzler that is purple. Fully compatible with the original.

### The Portal Condensation Grid UCP: 
- A custom fizzler built off the default paint fizzler. Blocks portal shots and fizzles portals, but does not affect cubes. 
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage.

### The Physics Obliteration Field UCP: 
- A custom fizzler built off the default paint fizzler. Fizzles cubes as well as most physic objects, explodes turrets, and destroys energy pellets. Has no effect on the player or portals. Big thanks to Areng for helping me get it to work. 
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage. _// Might want to make a signage that better indicates the field's functions_

### The Concentrated Particle Field UCP:
- A custom fizzler originally made for PHOBoS. It is a combination of my Portal Condensation Grid and the Physics Repulsion Field.
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage.

### The Portal Lights Enabler UCP:
- A custom item made partially using BEEPKG that enables `r_portal_use_dlights` when placed in a map.

### The Cube Dropper Gel Droppers UCP:
- Custom variant of the gel dropper that uses a cube dropper model instead. Use `Cube Type` to select the gel dropper. Also has a `Start Enabled` option. BEEPKG was used to generate a package template for this item.
- Has styled variants for Clean styles and P1 style.
- If set to drop Reflection Gel, it will pack the custom particles into the map.
- Uses the same instance for all types of gel.
