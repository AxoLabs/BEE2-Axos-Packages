# BEE2-Axos-Packages
**U**ser **c**reated **p**ackages (UCPs) for BEEMod made by AxoLabs.

Supported versions: BEEMod 2.4.43.0.

Supported styles: OG Clean, Clean and P1. Old AP styles have old AP-styled emitters and icons, but no support for them beyond that is planned.

Contributing guidelines: https://github.com/AxoLabs/BEE2-Axos-Packages/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md

The **Purple Paint Fizzler** UCP: 
- A modified version of the default paint fizzler that is purple.
- Fully compatible with the original paint fizzler.

The **Portal Condensation Grid** UCP: 
A custom fizzler built off the default paint fizzler. Blocks portal shots and fizzles portals, but does not affect cubes. 
- Uses Portal 1 emitter models in all styles, except old Aperture. 
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage.

The **Physics Obliteration Field** UCP: 
- A custom fizzler built off the default paint fizzler. Fizzles cubes as well as most physic objects, explodes turrets, and destroys energy pellets. Has no effect on the player or portals. 
- Uses Portal 1 emitter models in all styles, except old Aperture. 
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage. // Might want to make a signage that better indicates the field's functions
- Known issue: Turrets from a turret dropper destroyed by this don't get respawned in the overgrown style. I do not plan to fix this for various reasons.
