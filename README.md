# BEE2-Axo's-Packages
Supported version of BEEMod: 2.4.43.0.

Supported styles: OG Clean. Some items might have variants for other styles, but that does not mean they are supported.

*By the way, if you are going to use one of these in a puzzle, could you please credit me? I just want more people to know about these, up to you though :)*

## A list of items, ordered by significance
#### Schr√∂dinger's cubes
- A cut testing element reimplemented by me from scratch. They are a pair of cubes, when a laser hits the catcher cube, it'll come out of the emitter cube. You can read about them here: https://tcrf.net/Portal_2#Schr.C3.B6dinger.27s_Cube
- They are a bit buggy, but should work mostly fine. I have plans to slightly improve them in future updates, but don't take it as a promise.
#### Cube dropper gel Dropper:
- A custom variant of the gel dropper that uses a cube dropper model instead. Use `Cube Type` to select the gel dropper. Also has a `Start Enabled` option. BEEPKG was used to generate a package template for this item.
- Has styled variants for Clean styles and P1 style.
- In future updates, I plan to implement a way to control how heavy the gel flow is. The planned options are medium (current flow type), heavy (like in the Propulsion gel demonstration video), and bomb.
#### Portal condensation grid: 
- A custom fizzler. Blocks portal shots and fizzles portals, but does not affect cubes. 
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage.
#### Reflection gel fixer
- Changes the color of Reflection gel to be gray when splashed on surfaces and your face.
#### Portal support grid
- A custom fizzler that is essentially a toggle-able wall you can place portals on!
- Inspired by the Portalable Field from the _Divinity_ series.
#### Concentrated particle field:
- A custom fizzler originally made for PHOBoS. It is a combination of my Portal Condensation Grid and the Physics Repulsion Field.
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage.
#### Purple paint fizzler: 
- A modified version of the default paint fizzler that is purple. Fully compatible with the original. It was also used as a base for all of my custom fizzlers.
#### Portal lights enabler:
- A custom item that enables `r_portal_use_dlights` when placed in a map.
