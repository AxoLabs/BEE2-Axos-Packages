# BEE2-Axo's-Packages
Supported version of BEEMod: 2.4.43.0.

Supported styles: OG Clean. Some items might have variants for other styles, but usually it's because removing the styled variants takes more effort than keeping them.

By the way, if you are going to use one or more of my items in a puzzle, I'd greatly appreciate being credited for making them.

If you want to suggest an enhancement, or report a bug, please read the **contributing guidelines**: https://github.com/AxoLabs/BEE2-Axos-Packages/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md

## A list of items and their functions, ordered by significance
### Schr√∂dinger's cubes
A cut testing element reimplemented by me from scratch. They are a pair of cubes, when a laser hits the catcher cube, it'll come out of the emitter cube. You can read about them here: https://tcrf.net/Portal_2#Schr.C3.B6dinger.27s_Cube
- They are a bit buggy, but should work mostly fine. I have plans to slightly improve them in future updates, but don't take it as a promise.
- `Start reversed` controls whether the cube is a catcher cube (will power emitter cubes when touching a laser), or an emitter cube (will fire a laser when powered by a catcher cube).
- `Start enabled` controls whether the cube will drop automatically when the map is loaded or not.
- `Start active` controls whether a replacement cube will be delivered automatically when the cube is destroyed.
### Cube dropper gel dropper
A custom variant of the gel dropper that uses a cube dropper model instead.
- `Cube type` controls the type of the gel the dropper drops.
- `Button type` controls the gel flow.
- `Start enabled` controls whether the dropper starts active or not.
### Personalized hazard identification board
A test sign that can be easily customized. Read the `Instructions.txt` file carefully for more info.
- Use the Sign Maker to generate a template for this item to load: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Sign_Maker
### Suspended panel
A surface held by a panel a voxel above the ground.
- Check `start reversed` to make it non-portalable.
### Protruding surface
A portalable surface, protruding out a wall. Comes with a powerful portal magnet implemented into it.
### Protruding autoportal
An orange autoportal mounted on a protruding surface.
- `Start enabled` controls whether the portal starts active or not.
### Angled autoportal
An orange autoportal mounted on an angled surface.
- `Start enabled` controls whether the portal starts active or not.
### Small stairs
A set of static stairs, shrunk down to fit a single voxel.
### Half stairs
A set of static stairs which are only half a voxel high. You can line them next to each other so that they reach a full foxel of height.
- `Start reversed` controls which part of the voxel they occup: The bottom, or the top.
### Portal condensation grid
A custom fizzler. Blocks portal shots and fizzles portals, but does not affect cubes. 
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage.
### Concentrated particle field:
A custom fizzler originally made for PHOBoS. It is a combination of my Portal Condensation Grid and the Physics Repulsion Field.
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage.
### Purple paint fizzler
A modified version of the default paint fizzler that is purple. Fully compatible with the original. It was also used as a base for all of my custom fizzlers.
### Reflection gel fixer
Changes the color of Reflection gel to be gray when splashed on surfaces and your face.
