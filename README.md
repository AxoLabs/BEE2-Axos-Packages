# BEE2-Axo's-Packages
**U**ser **c**reated **p**ackages (UCPs) for BEEMod 2.4 made by AxoLabs.

Supported version of BEEMod: 2.4.43.0.

Supported styles: OG Clean, Clean and P1. Custom fizzlers have old AP styles emitters and icons, but no support for those styles beyond that is planned.

*By the way, if you are going to use one of these in a puzzle, could you please credit me? I just want more people to know about these, up to you though :)*

If you want to suggest an enhancement, or report a bug, please read the **contributing guidelines**: https://github.com/AxoLabs/BEE2-Axos-Packages/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md

The **Purple Paint Fizzler** UCP: 
- A modified version of the default paint fizzler that is purple.
- Fully compatible with the original paint fizzler.

The **Portal Condensation Grid** UCP: 
- A custom fizzler built off the default paint fizzler. Blocks portal shots and fizzles portals, but does not affect cubes. 
- Uses Portal 1 emitter models in all styles, except old Aperture. 
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage.

The **Physics Obliteration Field** UCP: 
- A custom fizzler built off the default paint fizzler. Fizzles cubes as well as most physic objects, explodes turrets, and destroys energy pellets. Has no effect on the player or portals. Big thanks to Areng for helping me get it to work. 
- Uses Portal 1 emitter models in all styles, except old Aperture. 
- Comes with a 1997 quality guaranteed signage. // Might want to make a signage that better indicates the field's functions
- Known issue: Turrets from a turret dropper destroyed by this don't get respawned in the overgrown style. I do not plan to fix this for various reasons.
- Known issue: The field does not fizzle cameras. I plan to fix this eventually, but it's not a high priority.
