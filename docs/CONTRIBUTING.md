# AxoLabs' UCP Contributing Guidelines
Did you find a bug in one of the UCPs, or do you want to suggest an enhancement to an existing package? If so, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could take the time to read this, thank you in advance! :D

Issues that do not follow these guidelines will be closed, and in extreme cases you may get banned from the repository.

### Be clear.
Please describe issues and enhancements as clearly as possible. Keep the issue easily readable and understandable, and provide as much information as you can. Unclear, sloppy issues are of no use and will be closed.
You are expected to reply if asked for more information. 

### Don't suggest new UCPs.
Self-explanatory. This repository is a place for people to download, and report issues with packages I develop for fun in my free time. Not a place to request new items/styles/etc..

### Do not reopen issues.
If your issue is closed, it is a deliberate decision made by me, and re-opening it will not do anything. 

### Do not create duplicate issues.
Please check if an issue regarding a certain matter hasn't already been opened. If it was, do not create another one. Duplicate issues will be closed immediately.

### Do not combine issues.
Please do not combine several bug reports/enhancement ideas into a single issue. While it may seem efficient, it also makes it a bit annoying to keep track of them.

### Test bugs in the latest version.
Please, when reporting a bug, make sure to test it in the latest *supported* version of BEEMod, and make sure you are using the latest version of the packages. I will not help you if either is outdated, as your problem may have been fixed in a newer release.
