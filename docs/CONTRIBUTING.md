# AxoLabs' UCP Contributing Guidelines
Did you find a bug in one of the UCPs that's problematic, or do you want to suggest an enhancement to the package? If so, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could take the time to read this. It is up to you whether you read the guidelines or not, but if you choose not to do so, know it does not justify not following them. I thank you in advance.

Issues that do not follow these guidelines will be closed, and repeatedly failing to follow these will result in your account getting banned from the repository.

### Keep issues clear and understandable.
Please describe issues and enhancements as clearly as possible. Keep the issue easily readable and understandable, and provide as much information as you can. Unclear, sloppily written issues will be closed.
You are expected to reply if asked for more information. 

### Do not reopen issues.
If your issue is closed, it was done deliberately by me. Please do not comment on closed issues either.

### Do not create duplicate issues/issues for already known bugs.
Please check if an issue regarding a certain matter hasn't already been opened. If it was, do not create another one. Duplicate issues will be closed immediately. Please also check the to-do list for the next update to see if your suggestion isn't already planned/worked on.
*// To do: Put together a list of all the known bugs with the package.*

### Do not combine issues.
Please do not combine several unrelated bug reports/enhancement ideas into a single issue. While it may seem efficient, it also makes it annoying to keep track of them.

### Report bugs/suggest enhancements in the issues section
Please report any bugs or enhancement ideas in the issues section. Suggestions/bugs that have not been reported there will not be looked into, no matter how severe they are.

### Know what you are talking about
Unless you have experience with how Portal 2 and the BEEMod work, please do not propose 'solutions' to bugs, or try to help with fixing them.

### Use issues for their intended purpose.
Please only open an issue if you want to suggest an enhancement to one of my packages or want to report a bug within them. Do not use them as a discussion forum, or a place to suggest new items. While reporting issues, please use the correct issue template.

### Test bugs in the latest, unmodified version.
Please, when reporting a bug, make sure to test it in the latest version of the BEEMod my packages support, and make sure you are using the latest version of the packages. I will not help you if either is outdated, as your problem may have been fixed in a newer release. If you have made any changes to the packages, I would be very grateful if you could, before reporting an issue, ensure the issue also persists in an unmodified version of the package.

I will not provide help if the version of the package you are using has been downloaded from elsewhere than this repository (with the only exception being the Portal Community server), as it was re-uploaded without my permission.

## To summarize: Use common sense and don't be annoying. Thank you in advance!
