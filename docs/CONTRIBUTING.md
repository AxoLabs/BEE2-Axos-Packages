# AxoLabs' UCP Contributing Guidelines
Did you find a bug in the UCP, or do you want to suggest an enhancement to the package? If so, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could take the time to read this. It is up to you whether you read the guidelines or not, but if you choose not to do so, know it does not justify not following them. I thank you in advance.

Issues that do not follow these guidelines will be closed, and in extreme cases you may get banned from the repository.

### Keep issues clear and understandable.
Please describe issues and enhancements as clearly as possible. Keep the issue easily readable and understandable, and provide as much information as you can. Unclear, sloppily written issues are of no use and will be closed.
You are expected to reply if asked for more information. 

### Do not reopen issues.
If your issue is closed, it is a deliberate decision made by me, and re-opening it will not do anything. This also means you shouldn't comment on closed issues.

### Do not create duplicate issues.
Please check if an issue regarding a certain matter hasn't already been opened. If it was, do not create another one. Duplicate issues will be closed immediately.

### Do not combine issues.
Please do not combine several bug reports/enhancement ideas into a single issue. While it may seem efficient, it also makes it a bit annoying to keep track of them.

### Do not spam issues.
Don't open five issues at once, especially if it's to report known bugs or suggest enhancement that are **really** obvious and likely haven't been added due to a good reason. Issues that break this will be closed immediately.

### Report bugs/suggest enhancements in the issues section
Please report any bugs or enhancement ideas in the issues section. I will not look into a suggestion/bug that has not been reported there, no matter how severe it is.

### Use issues for their intended purpose.
Please only open an issue if you want to suggest an enhancement to one of existing UCPs or want to report a bug. Do not use them as a discussion forum, or a place to suggest new items. This also means you are expected to use the appropriate issue template.

### Test bugs in the latest version.
Please, when reporting a bug, make sure to test it in the latest *supported* version of BEEMod, and make sure you are using the latest version of the packages. I will not help you if either is outdated, as your problem may have been fixed in a newer release.
